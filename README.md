### **Hi there!**

I am Odidi Naomi Tracy.

This space would throughly be dedicated to documenting my data science journey. I'll be posting projects I have worked on. Little beginnings!
I believe in the power of collaboration and a huge advocate hence I am open to collaboration on everything data science, machine learning and projects so do not hesitiate to reach out.
